## IP Address Tracker

The project is a solution for [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). It was build using React 18 with Typescript.

The goal was to fetch data from [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/), get the coordinates, and display the other details on a grid, as well as show the location respective to the geolocation using the library [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
